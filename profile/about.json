    "about": " Hi, Im Neil.\n\n\n Born in California, I moved to Bangalore, India when I was 3 and have lived here ever since. I completed my bachelors in technology in 2023 and am currently working as a computer vision analyst at Eli Lilly Co. \n\n Alongside my work in computer vision, I also work in the generative AI space on multiple projects. I love learning new technologies and broadening the way I can use them in my work. I treat every new project is an oppurtunity to learn.",
